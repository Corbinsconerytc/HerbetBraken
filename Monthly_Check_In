                       Monthly Check in
Recently I've been really busy, so I've decided to make this file to say what the current plans are
     Check-in 1 (3-7-25)
I haven't really been focused on the mod because of my confusion with blender and overall inexperience 
with animation and rigging. I still plan to fully add animation but not anytime soon. Right now I'm looking 
into making a horror Minecraft mod that may or may not be made. Overall, I have just been putting off the 
animations but I will get to it eventually. Also the video has the raw footage sorted but the script and
over plan for it is still in the works. Hopefully I will have and update for Herbert soon and hopefully 
Lethal Company will give us a good update soon :)
