                       Monthly Check in
Recently I've been really busy, so I've decided to make this file to say what the current plans are
     Check-in 1 (3-7-25)
I haven't really been focused on the mod because of my confusion with blender and overall inexperience 
with animation and rigging. I still plan to fully add animation but not anytime soon. Right now I'm looking 
into making a horror Minecraft mod that may or may not be made. Overall, I have just been putting off the 
animations but I will get to it eventually. Also the video has the raw footage sorted but the script and
over plan for it is still in the works. Hopefully I will have and update for Herbert soon and hopefully 
Lethal Company will give us a good update soon :)
    Check-in 2 (4-26-25)
I still am not focused on this mod that much, but i plan to work on it in the summer. School got busier 
somehow so I haven't done anything really. I still plan to rig Herbert and I think that will happen before
the video is made and I will edit it into the video. I don't think that the minecraft mod will be made but I'm 
hoping to mod for repo a bit when i get time. Sorry for not working on the mod :P
