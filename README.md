# Heya Chris!
This mod replaces the Bracken's model with a model of Herbert the Pervert from family Guy, as well changing some sound effects.

Thanks so much to Vulf for putting his code on thunderstore!
Video explaining how I made this and how to repeat it:(yet to be made. Its coming in like a month.)




## Changelog
### 0.1.0 
- Very beginning. Still some errors in the code but this is the first testing version. No model is present and this is just my base code.
### 0.2.0 
- First sucessful render of the model! The model is green, unanimated, t-posing, missing custom audio, and missing part of his face, but it is loaded and is functional as the bracken.
