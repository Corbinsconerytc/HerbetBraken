# Heya Chris!
This mod replaces the Bracken's model with a model of Herbert the Pervert from family Guy, as well changing some sound effects.

Video explaining how I made this and how to repeat it:(yet to be made. As of 3-7-25, I am still procrastinating on the video :(.)

## Changelog 
### 0.1.0
Very beginning. Still some errors in the code but this is the first testing version. No model is present and this is just my base code.
### 0.2.0
First successful render of the model! The model is green, unanimated, t-posing, missing custom audio, and missing part of his face, but it is loaded and is functional as the bracken.
### 1.0.0
Official Release! After 2 weeks of work I have finally got Herbert to work. You can now get this mod on Thunderstore. There is still much to add, but for now it is done. I will probably start work on it in a few days to add new features.
### 1.1.0 
Added SFX to Herbert. More to come soon!
### 1.1.1
Fixed two major bugs! The first bug fixed was the missing map marker which was fixed by adjusting how the code hides the Bracken Model. 
Second Bug fixed was Herbert clipping through walls, which was caused by some weird position code.
I have also decided to shelf the custom terminal message for now since I don't know how it works :P
### 1.1.2
Fixed bug where the bracken death sound wouldn't play.
### Prerelease 2.0.0
This is a prerelease for the github code that removes the cracks on the model. I plan to fully fix the model before publishing it on Thunderstore,
but for now, if you follow the Github, then you can use this code early. :)
### 2.0.0
Model rework... Kinda. Model's shaders have been fixed and the cracking bug has been fixed. This is a major update since I will most likely only be adding animations and doing bug fixes until its finished. This will be the last major update until animations get added. Bye for now :)
### 2.0.1
Killed God. Don't ask...
### 2.0.2
Fixed Herberts chase pitch and added glowing eyes.
